## WB
Data Writing:

In a write-back cache, data is written to the cache first and only written to the main memory when the cache block is evicted. This means that the main memory does not get updated immediately when a cache write occurs.
A dirty bit is set for the cache line when it is modified. If the cache line is evicted, the data is then written back to the main memory if the dirty bit is set.
## WT
Data Writing:

In a write-through cache, data is written to both the cache and the main memory simultaneously whenever a write operation occurs. This ensures that the main memory is always up-to-date with the cache.
There is no need for a dirty bit
